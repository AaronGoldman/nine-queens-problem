# THE PROBLEM OF THE EIGHT QUEENS

## Solving one problem in many langweges

It is requested to make a program generating all configurations of eight
queens on a chessboard of 8*8 squares such that no queen can take any of
the others. This means that in the configurations sought, no two queens
may be on the same row, on the same column or on the same diagonal.
